The first challenge was to understand Mozilla's culture and how to fit in. We had some meetings about how the program works and to get updates about TaskCluster, the project I'll be working at for the next 3 months. Mozilla has an awesome structure to receive new employees and I felt very welcomed, but that also means a lot of information to process and organize, which includes how to communicate with a fully remote team, setting up accounts, organizing meetings schedule, entering email lists, using Mozilla tools, joining IRC channels, etc.</p>\n<p>After organizing all these new information, it is time to dive into TaskCluster! From <a href=\"https://docs.taskcluster.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Taskcluster documentation</a> we can read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>TaskCluster</em> is the task execution framework that supports Mozilla's continuous integration and release processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For me it took a while to understand what TaskCluster is and what it is used for, but the process of understanding it is giving me a lot of \"ah-ha\" moments, which is a great feeling that shows me that I'm already learning a lot. For those who want to learn more, <a href=\"https://docs.taskcluster.net/tutorial/what-is-tc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this page</a> says a bit more about TaskCluster.</p>\n<p><strong>My job at TaskCluster:</strong> add robust AMI management to the TaskCluster AWS Provisioner. More details on bug <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1265390\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">#1265390</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>My first task:</strong> create AmiSet entity.</p>\n<p>Before I'm able to code anything, I have a bunch of things to do and to understand - the first one is to control the anxiety of wanting to start to code right away...</p>\n<p>I started by understanding the scope and all the parts involved. So a small glossary was very helpful for me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AMI</a>: \"An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server in the cloud.\"</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">AWS</a>: Amazon Web Services. A suite of cloud computing services offered by Amazon.

Entities are similar to rows. An entity has a primary key and a set of properties. A property is a name, typed-value pair, similar to a column.\" TaskCluster team has built a wrapper that is used in the project: <a href=\"https://github.com/taskcluster/azure-entities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Azure Table Storage Entities</a>.</li>\n<li>AMI Set: \"An AMI Set is a collection of AMIs with a single name (its AMI Set ID).
