It has been a lot of challenges, stress, learning and above all a huge personal growth! Some highlights of what I've learnt:</p>\n<p>✓ What is Taskcluster and how the AWS provisioner works (ok, there's still a lot to learn here).</p>\n<p>✓ What is an Azure entity and how to <a href=\"http://anarute.com/the-amiset-entity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">create one</a>.</p>\n<p>✓ How to run an application with no GUI interface and how to test things with <a href=\"http://mochajs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mocha</a> - and accept that some things we just <em>can't</em> see, but they work!</p>\n<p>✓ How to build a <a href=\"http://anarute.com/how-to-manage-ami-sets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React app</a> - I didn't build it from scratch but I definitely learnt a lot here.</p>\n<p>✓ Ask for help soon instead of wasting hours and hours stuck on a small issue (such as a typo).</p>\n<p>✓ Receiving a lot of comments and critics in your PR can actually be a good thing and an opportunity to learn.</p>\n<p>✓ Not be afraid of making mistakes and make <em>stupid</em> questions - there's no such thing as a stupid question.</p>\n<p>✓ How to work in a completely remote team and actually be very productive.</p>\n<p>✓ Got so many great tips from powerful women with the Women in Tech series sessions (thanks to everyone involved to make this happen).</p>\n<p>Beyond all the technical and professional things, I also had a lot of fun! I had the opportunity to go to London and have the experience of what if feels like to be a Mozillian. I met so many awesome people on this path that I can only say thank you!</p>\n<p>Mostly thanks to Dustin, an awesome person who I had the privilege of having as my mentor during this period. Thank you, Dustin, for teaching me so much in so little time! For being a great career advisor, for pushing me when I wasn't confident about myself and for being a friend. Selena, you became a role model for me! I'm lucky I had the chance to meet you and to have you as our team leader. Kristel, it was awesome to meet you and share my challenges and frustrations with you, you are a very strong person, I hope you the best, always. Wander, always ready to help me when I didn't wake up in a good relationship with English words, I'm glad to call you a friend now, for sure we are going to meet a lot here in Brazil. Thanks, John and Eli for the code reviews - I learnt a lot with them. Andrea and Hassan, it was nice to meet you in London, we had a great time! Greg, I wish you the best on your new role on the team, you are already doing a great job! Pete, Jonas and Brian, unfortunately, we didn't have the chance to work much together but I could see how much effort and dedication you all put on Taskcluster, it's really inspiring!</p>\n<p>Thank you, Taskcluster team, it was a pleasure to work with you all. Such a passionate and highly skilled team. I learnt a lot with all of you!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/posts/plops-1.jpg\" alt=\"Platform Operations team at London All Hands\"></p>\n<p>PS.: If you are reading this and intend to apply to Outreachy, please do it, you won't regret it!

In order to manage the AMI sets it was natural to build a tool for that. At first, our main goal is to build a minimal tool that allows us to list all the AMI sets known to the AWS provisioner and to add, edit and delete AMI sets.</p>\n<p>The final shape of an AMI set is this:</p>\n<pre>\"amis\": \n  [\n    {\n      \"region\": \"us-west-1\",\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n    }\n  ]\n</pre>\n<p>The ideal way to manage this is to allow the user to edit each field separately and check if the AMIs are valid automatically, but for now we are editing it as a JSON object since the back end already checks if the data is valid.</p>\n<p>The taskcluster tools are built with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">React</a> and before this project I have never built anything with it. So to start, there's no better way than compare how all the other tools are built. I knew that I needed to figure out how to list the amiSets and how to embed a code editor to be used to edit and create amiSets, so my main examples were the <a href=\"https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/roles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Roles tool</a> and the text editor from <a href=\"https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-creator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Task Creator tool</a>. The editor used in taskcluster tools is <a href=\"http://codemirror.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">CodeMirror,</a> a text editor built in javascript for the browser.</p>\n<p>My first step was to build the add amiSet function - after all, without amiSets I cannot test any other endpoint. I started to see progress when apparently no errors showed up when trying to add an amiSet, but to check if it really worked I needed the listing function, then the view function. After making this work, edit and delete were the final ones. A <a href=\"https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-tools/pull/121\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">first version</a> is already being reviewed and hopefully it will be published soon. We still have a lot of improvements to make but it seems good enough to move forward and start to incorporate the amiSets in the AWS provisioner architecture.</p>\n<p>Even after testing the AMI sets entity endpoints in the back end, I wasn't sure if it was really working because I could only see that it passed the tests that I have built, but I couldn't really see the amiSets (<em>and I must say I'm a very visual person</em>) but now with the tool I finally can see them, and it is grateful to see that what you're doing is working! - until it breaks something, of course.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"","author":{"id":"anarute","title":"anarute","path":"/author/anarute"}}},{"node":{"id":"437cfbeb0ed8dc8f278f64eb59e0357d","title":"The AmiSet Entity","datetime":"2016-06-10 14:30:43","path":"/the-amiset-entity","content":"<p>Taskcluster is a complex and big project and I'm working on a specific part of it: where we manage the Amazon instances and Machine Images (AMIs). As I've mentioned in my <a href=\"http://anarute.com/getting-started-with-taskcluster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">last post</a>, my job here starts by creating a new database entity called AMI set, which stores sets of AMIs keyed by region and virtualization type.</p>\n<p>My work during the last two weeks were to understand how the AWS provisioner project is organized and how to create a new entity. Since I was creating something I knew nothing about, start coding seems to be the hardest part because I have no references of things I've done before and I need to learn basically everything. A good advice for newbies would be to chop everything into the smallest parts we can (I think this fits for almost every job and area).</p>\n<p>I took the Worker Type entity as my starting point as suggested by <a href=\"http://code.v.igoro.us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Dustin</a> - my mentor - and wrote the AMI Set entity definition by checking what I could replicate from WorkerType and discarding what didn't make sense. Which ended up with this basic definition:</p>\n<pre>let AmiSet = base.Entity.configure({\n\nproperties: {\n    id: base.Entity.types.String,\n    amis: base.Entity.types.JSON,\n    // Store the date of last modification for this entity\n    lastModified: base.Entity.types.Date,\n  },\n});\n</pre>\n<p>This is a very simple entity and its core part is the <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">amis</code> property, which needs to store the AMIs by region and virtualization type. The thing is, since it is a \"generic\" JSON object we need to decide how the object will be. We have mainly two options:</p>\n<pre>{\n   \"us-west-1\": {\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n  },\n   \"us-east-1\": {\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>Or</p>\n<pre>[\n   {\n      \"region\": \"us-west-1\",\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n   }\n]\n</pre>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://github.com/taskcluster/aws-provisioner/pull/85#discussion-diff-66091884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">@jhford pointed and @djmitche agrees</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether we have a list of objects or a straight mapping is something that you'll have to pick. A list of objects is really nice because you can do really neat things with <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">Array.prototype.map</code> and <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">Array.prototype.filter</code>. A mapping is really nice because it's easier to address the values and it is impossible to have duplicates. Error checking with the object will be easier, but the list of objects is more in line with what we do elsewhere in the provisioner and probably what I'd prefer to see.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> we can see more methods that we can do with <code class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\">Array.prototype</code>. As explained above, probably we'll go with the list of objects option.</p>\n<p>After creating the entity I started adding its create and delete endpoints. The hardest part this time was to understand the functions and specially if I was dealing with instances, classes or properties.</p>\n<p>The thing that made me learn the most were <a href=\"https://github.com/taskcluster/aws-provisioner/pull/85\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the comments</a> Dustin and John made in my Pull Request. It is really helpful to know the things you are doing right or wrong and to know where to go from there. So an important advice here is to start sending patches as soon as possible and don't fear making mistakes - they will happen anyway and we can only learn from them.</p>\n","excerpt":"","description":"","author":{"id":"anarute","title":"anarute","path":"/author/anarute"}}},{"node":{"id":"65680ba6ce71a215b99397579f1b63d1","title":"Getting started with TaskCluster","datetime":"2016-05-27 14:30:43","path":"/getting-started-with-taskcluster","content":"<p>This was my first week working for Mozilla as an <a href=\"https://gnome.org/outreachy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Outreachy</a> intern. The first challenge was to understand Mozilla's culture and how to fit in. We had some meetings about how the program works and to get updates about TaskCluster, the project I'll be working at for the next 3 months. Mozilla has an awesome structure to receive new employees and I felt very welcomed, but that also means a lot of information to process and organize, which includes how to communicate with a fully remote team, setting up accounts, organizing meetings schedule, entering email lists, using Mozilla tools, joining IRC channels, etc.</p>\n<p>After organizing all these new information, it is time to dive into TaskCluster! From <a href=\"https://docs.taskcluster.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Taskcluster documentation</a> we can read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>TaskCluster</em> is the task execution framework that supports Mozilla's continuous integration and release processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For me it took a while to understand what TaskCluster is and what it is used for, but the process of understanding it is giving me a lot of \"ah-ha\" moments, which is a great feeling that shows me that I'm already learning a lot.
