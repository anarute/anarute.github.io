In order to manage the AMI sets it was natural to build a tool for that. At first, our main goal is to build a minimal tool that allows us to list all the AMI sets known to the AWS provisioner and to add, edit and delete AMI sets.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final shape of an AMI set is this:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E\"amis\": \n  [\n    {\n      \"region\": \"us-west-1\",\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n    }\n  ]\n\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal way to manage this is to allow the user to edit each field separately and check if the AMIs are valid automatically, but for now we are editing it as a JSON object since the back end already checks if the data is valid.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe taskcluster tools are built with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ffacebook.github.io\u002Freact\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EReact\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and before this project I have never built anything with it. So to start, there's no better way than compare how all the other tools are built. I knew that I needed to figure out how to list the amiSets and how to embed a code editor to be used to edit and create amiSets, so my main examples were the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftools.taskcluster.net\u002Fauth\u002Froles\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ERoles tool\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and the text editor from \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftools.taskcluster.net\u002Ftask-creator\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ETask Creator tool\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. The editor used in taskcluster tools is \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fcodemirror.net\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003ECodeMirror,\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a text editor built in javascript for the browser.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first step was to build the add amiSet function - after all, without amiSets I cannot test any other endpoint. I started to see progress when apparently no errors showed up when trying to add an amiSet, but to check if it really worked I needed the listing function, then the view function. After making this work, edit and delete were the final ones.

As I've mentioned in my \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fanarute.com\u002Fgetting-started-with-taskcluster\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003Elast post\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, my job here starts by creating a new database entity called AMI set, which stores sets of AMIs keyed by region and virtualization type.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy work during the last two weeks were to understand how the AWS provisioner project is organized and how to create a new entity. Since I was creating something I knew nothing about, start coding seems to be the hardest part because I have no references of things I've done before and I need to learn basically everything. A good advice for newbies would be to chop everything into the smallest parts we can (I think this fits for almost every job and area).\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI took the Worker Type entity as my starting point as suggested by \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fcode.v.igoro.us\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EDustin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E - my mentor - and wrote the AMI Set entity definition by checking what I could replicate from WorkerType and discarding what didn't make sense. Which ended up with this basic definition:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003Elet AmiSet = base.Entity.configure({\n\nproperties: {\n    id: base.Entity.types.String,\n    amis: base.Entity.types.JSON,\n    \u002F\u002F Store the date of last modification for this entity\n    lastModified: base.Entity.types.Date,\n  },\n});\n\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very simple entity and its core part is the \u003Ccode class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\"\u003Eamis\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E property, which needs to store the AMIs by region and virtualization type. The thing is, since it is a \"generic\" JSON object we need to decide how the object will be. We have mainly two options:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E{\n   \"us-west-1\": {\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n  },\n   \"us-east-1\": {\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n  }\n}\n\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOr\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cpre\u003E[\n   {\n      \"region\": \"us-west-1\",\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n   },\n   {\n      \"region\": \"us-east-1\",\n      \"hvm\": \"ami-111\",\n      \"pv\": \"ami-222\"\n   }\n]\n\u003C\u002Fpre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Ftaskcluster\u002Faws-provisioner\u002Fpull\u002F85#discussion-diff-66091884\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003E@jhford pointed and @djmitche agrees\u003C\u002Fa\u003E:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether we have a list of objects or a straight mapping is something that you'll have to pick.

A mapping is really nice because it's easier to address the values and it is impossible to have duplicates. Error checking with the object will be easier, but the list of objects is more in line with what we do elsewhere in the provisioner and probably what I'd prefer to see.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fdeveloper.mozilla.org\u002Fen-US\u002Fdocs\u002FWeb\u002FJavaScript\u002FReference\u002FGlobal_Objects\u002FArray\u002Fprototype\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"\u003EHere\u003C\u002Fa\u003E we can see more methods that we can do with \u003Ccode class=\"shiki-inline\" style=\"background: #2e3440; color: #d8dee9\"\u003EArray.prototype\u003C\u002Fcode\u003E.
