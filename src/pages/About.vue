          Iâ€™m a web developer with an entrepreneurial background, passionate
          about solving problems and using technology to positively impact
          society. I love spending my free time with friends and family,
          watching TV series, and playing video games. Currently learning how to
          play the piano.
        </p>

          At the moment, I work at
          <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a> as a software developer
          at the internal tools. I'm a generalist and normally present myself as
          a full stack developer but recently I've been turning into a legacy
          code specialist (or may I say restorer?). Yes, believe it or not I'm
          actually enjoying it!
        </p>

          You can find me on
          <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ana_rute">Twitter</a> where I'm most
          active or if you want to dig more about my professional background you
          can check my
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anarute">Linkedin</a>
          profile. Some part of my work is open and you can check it on my
          <a href="https://github.com/anarute">Github</a> profile.
